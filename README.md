# Patient Appointments 
_By(Abbey Christian Banafo)_

## Introduction
*A patient spends the time and energy to visit the doctor and is schedulled for an appointment. But then this happens: a **no-show** where some patients do not go for their appointments. What could be the possible causes of this? This is a dataset from kaggle where we look at the behaviour of patients in response to their appointments to treatments. The variables involved were many but the most relevant in our case was the **no-show** variable which basically tells us the outcome of an appointment.*

## Insights
*Insights were generated including:*
> 1. *What was the percentage of those who showed up to those that did not for the overall dataset?*
> 2. What was the gender distribution for the overall appointments turn out?*
> 3. *Q2. Does any form of defect or addiction, affect a patientâ€™s chances of showing up? What was the total effect these factors had on a patient's show up response?*
> 4. *Which age group showed up the most for the appointments?*

## Summary Stats
> * _There were a total of **62,298** unique patients with **110,526** unique appointment id's. Out of the **62,298** patients, there were **88,207** of their appointments_id's, which makes up about **79.81%** of the number of appointment_ids that did show up for their appointments while the other ~**20.19%** were those that did not show up for their appointment. This implies more people showed up on average than those that did not._
> * _In total, there were **26,412** appointments with either of the conditions(alcohol, hypertension, handicap and diabetes). Of this figure, **82.14%** of them did show up for their appointments which did contribute to about **24.60%** of the total number of appointment_ids that showed up for their appointments. The remaining ~**17.86%** of those that had either of the above conditions and did not show up for their appointments were about **21.13%** of the total appointment_ids that did not show up for their appointments_.
